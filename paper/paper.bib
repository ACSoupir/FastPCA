  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Immunotherapy has improved survival for patients with
              advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), but resistance
              to therapy develops in most patients. We use cellular-resolution
              spatial transcriptomics in patients with immunotherapy na{\"\i}ve
              and exposed primary ccRCC tumors to better understand
              immunotherapy resistance. RESULTS: Spatial molecular imaging of
              tumor and adjacent stroma samples from 21 tumors suggests that
              viable tumors following immunotherapy harbor more stromal CD8 + T
              cells and neutrophils than immunotherapy na{\"\i}ve tumors. YES1
              is significantly upregulated in immunotherapy exposed tumor
              cells. Spatial GSEA shows that the epithelial-mesenchymal
              transition pathway is spatially enriched and the associated
              ligand-receptor transcript pair COL4A1-ITGAV has significantly
              higher autocorrelation in the stroma after exposure to
              immunotherapy. More integrin $\alpha$V + cells are observed in
              immunotherapy exposed stroma on multiplex immunofluorescence
              validation. Compared to other cancers in TCGA, ccRCC tumors have
              the highest expression of both COL4A1 and ITGAV. Assessing bulk
              RNA expression and proteomic correlates in CPTAC databases
              reveals that collagen IV protein is more abundant in advanced
              stages of disease. CONCLUSIONS: Spatial transcriptomics of
              samples of 3 patient cohorts with cRCC tumors indicates that
              COL4A1 and ITGAV are more autocorrelated in immunotherapy-exposed
              stroma compared to immunotherapy-na{\"\i}ve tumors, with high
              expression among fibroblasts, tumor cells, and endothelium.
              Further research is needed to understand changes in the ccRCC
              tumor immune microenvironment and explore potential therapeutic
              role of integrin after immunotherapy treatment.",

              biobank data",
  author   = "Li, Zilong and Meisner, Jonas and Albrechtsen, Anders",
  abstract = "Principal component analysis (PCA) is widely used in statistics,
              machine learning, and genomics for dimensionality reduction and
              uncovering low-dimensional latent structure. To address the
              challenges posed by ever-growing data size, fast and
              memory-efficient PCA methods have gained prominence. In this
              paper, we propose a novel randomized singular value decomposition
              (RSVD) algorithm implemented in PCAone, featuring a window-based
              optimization scheme that enables accelerated convergence while
              improving the accuracy. Additionally, PCAone incorporates
              out-of-core and multithreaded implementations for the existing
              Implicitly Restarted Arnoldi Method (IRAM) and RSVD. Through
              comprehensive evaluations using multiple large-scale real-world
              data sets in different fields, we show the advantage of PCAone
              over existing methods. The new algorithm achieves significantly
              faster computation time while maintaining accuracy comparable to
              the slower IRAM method. Notably, our analyses of UK Biobank,
              comprising around 0.5 million individuals and 6.1 million common
              single nucleotide polymorphisms, show that PCAone accurately
              computes the top 40 principal components within 9 h. This
              analysis effectively captures population structure, signals of
              selection, structural variants, and low recombination regions,
              utilizing <20 GB of memory and 20 CPU threads. Furthermore, when
              applied to single-cell RNA sequencing data featuring 1.3 million
              cells, PCAone, accurately capturing the top 40 principal
              components in 49 min. This performance represents a 10-fold

The software, written in both R and python languages, makes use of torch for internal matrix computations, and enables GPU acceleration, when available. qrpca provides similar functionalities to prcomp (R) and sklearn (python) packages respectively. A benchmark test shows that qrpca can achieve computational speeds 10–20 × faster for large dimensional matrices than default implementations, and is at least twice as fast for a standard decomposition of spectral data cubes.
