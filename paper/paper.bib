  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Immunotherapy has improved survival for patients with
              advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), but resistance
              to therapy develops in most patients. We use cellular-resolution
              spatial transcriptomics in patients with immunotherapy na{\"\i}ve
              and exposed primary ccRCC tumors to better understand
              immunotherapy resistance. RESULTS: Spatial molecular imaging of
              tumor and adjacent stroma samples from 21 tumors suggests that
              viable tumors following immunotherapy harbor more stromal CD8 + T
              cells and neutrophils than immunotherapy na{\"\i}ve tumors. YES1
              is significantly upregulated in immunotherapy exposed tumor
              cells. Spatial GSEA shows that the epithelial-mesenchymal
              transition pathway is spatially enriched and the associated
              ligand-receptor transcript pair COL4A1-ITGAV has significantly
              higher autocorrelation in the stroma after exposure to
              immunotherapy. More integrin $\alpha$V + cells are observed in
              immunotherapy exposed stroma on multiplex immunofluorescence
              validation. Compared to other cancers in TCGA, ccRCC tumors have
              the highest expression of both COL4A1 and ITGAV. Assessing bulk
              RNA expression and proteomic correlates in CPTAC databases
              reveals that collagen IV protein is more abundant in advanced
              stages of disease. CONCLUSIONS: Spatial transcriptomics of
              samples of 3 patient cohorts with cRCC tumors indicates that
              COL4A1 and ITGAV are more autocorrelated in immunotherapy-exposed
              stroma compared to immunotherapy-na{\"\i}ve tumors, with high
              expression among fibroblasts, tumor cells, and endothelium.
              Further research is needed to understand changes in the ccRCC
              tumor immune microenvironment and explore potential therapeutic
              role of integrin after immunotherapy treatment.",
